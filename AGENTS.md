# QiDao Project Status & Guidelines (AGENTS.md)

This document serves as a source of truth for AI agents working on the QiDao project. It tracks confirmed requirements, technical decisions, architecture, and progress.

## 1. Project Overview
QiDao (Tao of Go) is a modern Go (Weiqi) board editor and AI analysis tool, primarily for macOS, inspired by Lizzieyzy.

## 2. Technical Stack
- **UI Layer**: SwiftUI (macOS Native)
- **Core Logic Layer**: Rust (`qidao-core`)
  - **Scope**: SGF parsing & tree management, GTP/Analysis API orchestration, Go rules engine (validation, capture logic).
- **Interoperability**: **UniFFI** (Swift-Rust bridging).
  - **Status**: Initialized with proc-macro support and Swift binding generation.

## 3. Directory Structure
- `QiDao/`: SwiftUI application source code.
- `qidao-core/`: Rust-based core logic.
  - `src/lib.rs`: Main entry point for UniFFI exports.
  - `src/bin/uniffi-bindgen.rs`: CLI tool for generating bindings.
  - `out/`: Generated Swift/C bindings.
- `screens/`: UI reference images.
- `init-spec.md`: Detailed functional and non-functional requirements.

## 4. Key Confirmed Requirements
- **SGF Handling**: Full support for SGF tree, editing, and saving.
- **AI Integration**: 
  - Support for GTP and KataGo Analysis API.
  - Real-time analysis, win-rate graphs, and blunder detection.
- **UI/UX**:
  - Modern macOS native look and feel.
  - Graphical Variation Tree visualization.
  - GPU-accelerated board rendering (60/120fps).
  - **Localization**: Architecture must support i18n; Chinese-only for the initial phase.
- **Performance**: Multi-threaded engine communication, low latency.

## 5. Architecture Design
1. **Core Logic (Rust)**: SGF Tree, Rules Engine, Engine Communication.
2. **Application State (Swift)**: ViewModel layer, managing engine lifecycle and UI state.
3. **UI (SwiftUI)**: View layer, high-performance board rendering.

## 6. Project Progress
- [x] Initial requirements defined ([init-spec.md](init-spec.md)).
- [x] Requirements updated with AI Analysis API, Variation Tree, and GPU acceleration.
- [x] Project structure initialized with `QiDao/` and `qidao-core/`.
- [x] **Swift-Rust Bridge**: Confirmed UniFFI as the bridging solution.
- [x] **Core Setup**: Initialized Rust library in `qidao-core` with UniFFI support.
- [x] **GUI Prototype**: Created basic `BoardView` and `BoardViewModel` in SwiftUI.
- [x] **Core Integration (Initial)**: Built Rust static library and generated Swift bindings; placed them in `QiDao/QiDao/Core`.

## 7. Immediate TODOs
1. **Xcode Configuration**: Manually link `libqidao_core.a` and configure modulemap paths in Xcode.
2. **SGF**: Implement basic SGF parsing in the core layer (Rust).
3. **Board Interaction**: Implement stone placement and basic Go rules in Rust.
4. **Engine**: Implement basic GTP communication in Rust.
